### Project Brief

I had a very tight schedule for this one and no real concept in mind except for a inspiration site they gave me. I saw it as a challenge and made my deadline.

### Featured Tech

- Bigcommerce Platform
- handlebars.js & HTML
- SaaS with Fully Responsive Design
- Hero, accordion, youtube videos, Newsletter, Pixilee
- Design in Figma

### Results

This project was my first taste of a client that was not sure what they wanted. I was given no assets or content at first so it was difficult to visualize. I had to go back several times and undo features I had created due to the many key stake holders in the company I was working with, but in the end it all came together and they loved it.

After this project I created my design process to make my life and the client's easier.
