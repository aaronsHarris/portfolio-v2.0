### Project Brief

I helped Bing while with Brod Solutions. He wanted a eye catching colorful aesthetic with big splashy images to compete with the competition. I incorperated animations, transitions, and a material design theme

### Featured Tech


- Next.js
- Bootstrap 5 & SaaS
- Redux
- slick carousals, accordions, google maps
- Fully responsive design

### Results

Bing loved the theme! It did take me a little longer than expected, a little over a week, but made the deadline. This link is to one of the last pushes before production.
